## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view.

Initially I tried to create this project using create-react-app with javascript but I
ran into CORS errors when trying to make the fetch request. As a workaround for this I instead 
built the app with Next.js.
